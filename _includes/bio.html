  <strong>Fursona Species:</strong> My current favorite is my black male wolf named Eli. He wears a trench coat and a baseball cap. Yes, he is pure edginess with a gooey center. I created him before I ever watched PotO, but picture Erik and you basically have Eli. I also have a female bunny named Lizzy. She's bubbly, full of nervous energy and silly ideas, and would never harm a bug. Eli and Lizzy are two halves of the same whole, two sides of my personality.<br>
