<!--<p><strong>Fursona Species:</strong> (Under Construction) My current favorite is my black male wolf named Eli Lobo. He wears a trench coat and a baseball cap. Yes, he is pure edginess with a gooey center. I created him before I ever watched PotO, but picture Erik and you basically have Eli. Lobo means wolf. I also have a female bunny named Lily Lago. She's bubbly, full of nervous energy and silly ideas, and would never harm a bug. Lago means lake, but it's also short for lagomorph. Eli and Lily are two halves of the same whole, two sides of my personality. They are in love.</p>-->
